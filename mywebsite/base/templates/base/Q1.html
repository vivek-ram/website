			<h1>how's my life in second year of university.</h1>


      <p>Well, the second year has been really productive and I have gained really good experience in job exploring and going through interviews. I was quite fun at the same time I learned many things. I created the projects to put on my cv before applying to jobs. When my projects are done I started to apply the companies for my placement year. The soon I got the replies back from companies that I been selected for an interview and psychometric test I felt excited and some of the companies gave like a coding project. It was really interesting. The project is about computer vision to detect the baseball bat from the set of images they gave and I use C and C++ for this project. I felt it was a really easy problem because I have done image recognition by using python and used Tensorflow and Opencv to detect the images. But as I started to work image recognition in C and C++ it was really complicated because the AI libraries in C and C++ are really less compared to the python and I started to finish this project before the deadline. Unfortunately, I didn’t do it well and the results are not good. But when doing this project I gained a lot of knowledge like what the image recognition algorithms for C and C++ and what are the libraries used in C and C++ for ML. So yeah even I didn’t finish the project but I learned a lot and next when I applying for this company I am pretty sure I can do it this time. Apart from interviews, I have to balance my academics and I got 6 modules this year and I really enjoyed following modules

      <h2>TEAM PROJECT :-</h2>
      <p>It was really so amazing and I had hella fun. my team has 5 people and we have to create a game using java and use JavaFX. As it was a game project I was really excited to work with my team members and I think we really great team we split the work and have meetings every week. My part in this game is to create the platform and the player and enemies. It was great but it was a little disappointing that our networking for multiplayer isn’t working as we expected. Except that it was a really amazing experience working with my team members.

      <h2>Functional Programming :- </h2>
      <p>It was the advance topic that is continuation of my 1st year module and in first year it was logics and computation. I really love logics it was really challenging and It was really deal when proving something with logics I find it was quite fun and it is a bit of math include in it which I am good in. And the second part is computation using the logics which I learned and solving them using functional programming I.e agda. First thing I felt it is quite different than the programming languages I learned which made me even more curious to work on this. So in my second year it is continuation this year we learned Haskell which is really good and more understandable than agda. It was kinda hard but I had fun by doing Haskell in my assignments.
